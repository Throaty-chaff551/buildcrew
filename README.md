# BuildCrew

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md) | [日本語](README_ja.md)

**Build your AI crew. Run your AI company.**

BuildCrew is an open-source platform that organizes multiple AI agents into a virtual company. Chat with your AI CEO (Aria), she'll build your team, plan your project, and get things done — autonomously.

> If AI agents are employees, BuildCrew is the company they work in.

## How It Works

```
Create Company  →  Chat with Aria  →  Launch Plan  →  Execute  →  Dashboard
```

1. **Create a company** — Pick a name, mission, and industry template
2. **Chat with Aria (AI CEO)** — She asks smart questions, one at a time, with her own analysis and suggestions
3. **Launch** — Aria summarizes the plan, team, and estimated cost. You review
4. **Execute** — One click. Aria hires agents, creates goals, assigns tasks
5. **Dashboard** — Watch your AI company work: org chart, tasks, progress

- **Org Charts** — Departments, reporting lines, role-based hierarchy
- **Task Management** — Goals, tasks, assignment, progress tracking
- **Smart Router** — Routes tasks to the best agent based on skills, cost, availability
- **Guardian** — Security monitoring, anomaly detection, automatic alerts
- **Review Pipeline** — 3-stage review: auto check, peer review, human approval
- **Knowledge Hub** — Semantic search, auto-extraction, shared context
- **Multi-Model** — Works with Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, and more
- **i18n** — English, 简体中文, 日本語
- **Digital Humans** — Animated Q-style 3D characters for each agent
